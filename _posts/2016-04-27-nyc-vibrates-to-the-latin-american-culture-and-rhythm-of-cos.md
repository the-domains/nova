**NYC Vibrates to the Latin American Culture and Rhythm of COSA NUESTRA **

It was the perfect Spring evening, perfect location and perfect venue for the launch of COSA NUESTRA (Our Thing) on April 23rd. Located in the heart of New York City, where the Lower East Side meets Soho, Zen House welcomed a diverse crowd of Latinos eager to celebrate Latin America's gastronomy, culture, art and music at the beat of COSA NUESTRA. A wide variety of tempting and exquisite appetizers flowed continuously through the floor featuring artistic versions of delicacies such as the scrumptious _alcapurrias_ and _bacalaítos_ as you sipped signature libations including my favorite, the _Lavender Mule_, a delicious concoction of Aylesbury Duck Vodka, Lavender infusion, Citrus and Ginger Tea. 

Head upstairs and navigate through the rhythm of salsa and a display of artworks by a talented group of up and coming Boricua and Dominican artists based in New York, curated by DIPSTERS. An outdoor patio opens up to a gastronomic haven with the protagonist -- a roasted pig on the spit. On the right, you were greeted by a combination platter of octopus, pork, and chicken skewers or an _escabeche_ served on a handmade corn flatbread. On the right, the perfect match to the roasted pork -- a perfectly seasoned and shaped _mofongo_ (mashed plantain) stuffed with pork. And for those who like hot sauce, a bottle of homemade Puerto Rican _pique_ (hot sauce) was not to be missed. 

The highlight of the evening was the performance of _pleneros_ accompanied by a masterful dancer on stilts, _vejigantes_ with colorful costumes and masks, and the exclusive _Cabezudo _(Big head) personifying Héctor Lavoe of Fania All-Stars -- the inspiration of COSA NUESTRA.

**Meet the Talent Behind COSA NUESTRA**

Manolo López, creator of the comfort food pop-up Mofon\*GO in Brooklyn, New York teams up with a group of top Puerto Rican chefs and mixologists to curate COSA NUESTRA'S launch event in New York City on April 23rd. Rooted in the iconic Fania All-Stars, COSA NUESTRA is a celebration of Latin America's cuisine, art, music and culture. "With so many negative news headlines surrounding Puerto Rico, this is our way of shedding light on the positives - the vibrant culture, the passionate spirit, and the tight sense of community," says López.

COSA NUESTRA's team of Puerto Rican chefs and mixologists include: Xavier Pacheco, chef of La Jaquita Baya; Leslie Cofresí, co-founder of La Factoría and owner of La Alcapurria Quemá; Roberto Berdecía, co-founder of La Factoría; Raúl Correa, executive chef of Zest Restaurant in the San Juan Water Beach Club Hotel; René Marichal, chef and partner of Avocado Cocina Local & Patio Bar, Gabriel Antúnez, chef of La Hacienda Meat Center, and Pit Master Fernando Luis Narváez. 

The COSA NUESTRA repertoire of artists include curator, Daniel Baez of DIPSTER, and artwork by talented Puerto Rican and Dominican New York-based artists featuring Pedro Adorno, Héctor Madera, Héctor Arce Espasas, Jonathan Torres, Fernando Pintado, Heryk Tomassini, Ricardo Cabret, Sebastian Vallejo, Christopher Rivera, Joiri Minaya, and Dulcina Abreu. Music performances featured the talent of Flaco Navaja and the Razor Blades, and DJ sets from Raquel Berríos (Buscabulla) and Riobamba. 

Stay tuned for the next COSA NUESTRA event!
